    Many real analysis textbooks begin their presentation, with a construction of the real numbers.

    The construction of the real numbers takes a lot of time.  

    Moreover, once it's done, nothing much has been gained!  Once the construction is done, we never refer back to what we learned from it!  Literally the *only* value of the the construction, is to ensure that the real numbers exist.

    Although the axiomatic approach cuts out the construction steps, it still takes a while to even just state the axioms.

    Therefore we will break up the axioms into component ideas, to make each idea more digestible.  These include the ideas of

    * a ring
