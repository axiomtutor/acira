        In this lesson we prove theorems which justify our intuitions about the geometry of the numberline.  The first theorem which will be a tool for the other theorems, is the `Thousand miles` theorem. 

        The name is a metaphor for the saying "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step".

        In this theorem, $y$ will be the thousand mile journey (or just any "really large distance").  $x$ will be the size of a single step (usually "small").  $n$ will be the number of steps required.

In brief he said that, with a long enough lever he could move the world.  In this metaphor, $y$ is the weight of the world, $x$ is his puny little force applied to the lever, and $n$ is the length of the lever.

        However, I hope that once I express these ideas, their correctness will be obvious.  In future exercises you will solve similar problems that also make use of the well-ordering of the integers, and thereby develop some facility with this theorem.
