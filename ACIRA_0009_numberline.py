        We try to do so with a philosophy that is not shared by every other textbook:  We first show that every real number is "well-approximated by" a rational number (or a sequence of rational numbers).  

        Then we try to use a corresponding fact which can be leveraged to prove what is needed for the real numbers.

        This hopefully does two things: Cuts down on how much we need to appeal to anything which couldn't better and more easily be handled by the rational numbers alone.  And it helps to display exactly what is different, when we finally have to appeal to something distinct about the reals.

        The first theorem which will be a tool for the other theorems, is the `Thousand miles` theorem.

        It is a rare occurrence that the Wikipedia page for a mathematical idea can be helpful, but in this one it is:  [Wikipedia: Archimedean Property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property).

        This theorem is named in honor of Archimedes, perhaps in part, because of the [Archimedes physical principle about leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever#Lever_History).  In brief he said that, with a long enough lever he could move the world.  In this metaphor, $y$ is the weight of the world, $x$ is his puny little force applied to the lever, and $n$ is the length of the lever.
