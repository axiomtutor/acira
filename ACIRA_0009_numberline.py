        In this lesson we prove theorems which justify our intuitions about the geometry of the numberline.  The first theorem which will be a tool for the other theorems, is the `Thousand miles` theorem. 

        The name is a metaphor for the saying "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step".

        In this theorem, $y$ will be the thousand mile journey (or just any "really large distance").  $x$ will be the size of a single step (usually "small").  $n$ will be the number of steps required.

        It is a rare occurrence that the Wikipedia page for a mathematical idea can be helpful, but in this one it is:  [Wikipedia: Archimedean Property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property).

        This theorem is named in honor of Archimedes, perhaps in part, because of the [Archimedes physical principle about leverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lever#Lever_History).  In brief he said that, with a long enough lever he could move the world.  In this metaphor, $y$ is the weight of the world, $x$ is his puny little force applied to the lever, and $n$ is the length of the lever.

        That technique is not available for proving facts about the real numbers, because we don't know that real numbers have an expression in terms of anything simpler (like rational numbers).

        Using metaphors like the ones we used for the `Thousand miles` theorem, one should be able to take small enough "steps", starting at 0, eventually crossing to the other side of $a$, but not stepping so large that we immediately also step over $b$.

        To make this idea rigorous, we probably want a small step size, $\varepsilon$.  It should be smaller than $b-a$, the length of the interval $(a,b)$.  We can obtain this can appeal to the `1/n approaches 0` theorem.  

        We also want a "number of steps" which step us from 0, over $a$ and into the region $(a,b)$.  We can obtain this by a separate appeal to the `Thousand miles` theorem.
