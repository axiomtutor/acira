        We now know what the real numbers are! Hooray! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

        Celebartion is now over ðŸ˜’, and we return to hard work, learning the basic properties of these numbers.

        In this chapter we will prove several properties that we will prove theorems which justify some of our geometric intuitions about the real number line.  

        For instance, we will show that the number line extends out to infinity (i.e. there is no largest number).  We will show that between any two real numbers there is another real number.  We will show that for any number, there is a sequence of rational numbers which approaches it (called the "density" of the rationals in the reals).  And so on.
