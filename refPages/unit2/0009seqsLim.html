    <h1>Lesson 0009: Sequences</h1>

    <div class="def">
        For any $m\in\Bbb N$ we define $\Bbb N^{\ge m} = \Bbb N \cap [m,\infty)$.  <br>

        For any set $X$, a <b>sequence of $X$ starting at $m$</b> is any function $a:\Bbb N^m\to X$ for any $m\in\Bbb N$.  <br>

        The image of $k$ under $a$ is written $a(k)$, using standard function notation.  However, for sequences, we prefer to write this instead as $a_k$, and we prefer to call this the <b>$k$th term of the sequence</b>.  <br>

        Although the function is denoted by $a$, for sequences we prefer to denote it as $(a_k)_{k=m}$, where $m$ is the "starting index" of the sequence.  <br>

        If $m,p\in\Bbb N$ and if $m\le p$, then we may restrict $(a_k)_{k=m}$ to the domain $N^{\ge p}$.  We denote this restriction as $(a_k)_{k=p}$, and we call this the <b>$p$th tail of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b>.  <br>

        If $(i_k)_{k=p} : \Bbb N^{\ge p} \to \Bbb N^{\ge m}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of $\Bbb N^{\ge m}$, then the composition $(a_k)_{k=m} \circ (i_k)_{k=p}$ is also a sequence of $X$.  In this case, we write this sequence as $(a_{i_k})_{k=p}$ and call this a <b>subsequence of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b>.  <br>

        If $a,b$ are elements in an ordered field, we define the <b>absolute value of $a$</b> by 

        $$ |a| = \begin{cases}
            a & \text{ if } 0\preceq a \\
            -a & \text{ if } a\prec 0
        \end{cases}$$

        We define <b>the distance between $a$ and $b$</b> by $|a-b|$.  <br>

        For a given $\varepsilon\in F^{\ge 0}$, we say that $a$ is <b>within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if $|a-b|\prec \varepsilon$.  <br>

        For a given sequence of $F$, say $(a_k)_{k=m}$, we say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is <b>within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if every term of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  <br>

        We say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is <b>eventually within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if some tail of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  <br>

        We say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ <b>converges to $b$</b> if for every $\varepsilon\in F^+$, eventually $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  In this case we say that $b$ is the <b>limit of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b> and we write 
        
        $$ \lim_{k\to\infty}a_k = b $$
        or
        $$ a_k \to b $$

        Note that this notation does not allow you to determine the starting index of the sequence.  Implicitly, the starting index is 1, or the least natural number for which the sequence is defined.
    </div>

    Throughout this section, assume that $m,p,q\in\Bbb N$, and $(a_k)_{k=m}, (b_k)_{k=m}, (c_k)_{k=m}$ are sequences of $\Bbb R$.  Also assume that $(i_k)_{k=p}:\Bbb N^{\ge p}\to \Bbb N^{\ge m}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of $\Bbb N^{\ge m}$.

      <i>Statement</i>: Let $x\in\Bbb R^+$ and $y\in\Bbb R$.  Then there is an $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $y < nx$.<br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: Define $S = \{n\in\Bbb N: nx < y \}$.  If $S = \emptyset$ then $y < 1x$ and the theorem holds, so assume for the rest of the proof that $S\ne \emptyset$.  <br>

      $S$ is then bounded above by $y/x$.  Since $S$ is a nonempty set of integers, bounded above, then $\max(S)$ exists.  <br>

      Therefore $\max(S)+1\notin S$ and therefore $y < (\max(S)+1)x$ by definition of $S$.  <br>

      Therefore the $n$ required by the theorem is $\max(S)+1$.  <br>

      An infinitesimal is a nonzero number smaller than every positive rational number.  As a corrolary, of this theorem, there is no infinitesimal real number.<br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: Let $a\in\Bbb R^+$.  By the <tt>Seq. thousand steps</tt> theorem, there is an $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $1 < an$. <br>

      Therefore $\frac 1 n < a$.  <br>

      A sequence is increasing if and only if $a_{k} < a_{k+1}$ for each $m\le k$.

    <details>
      <summary>Statement and proof.</summary>

      If $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is increasing then it follows trivially that $a_k < a_{k+1}$ for each $m\le k$.  <br>

      Assume that $a_k < a_{k+1}$ for every $m\le k$.  Now let $m\le p < q$.  <br>

      Then 
      $$ a_p < a_{p+1} < \cdots < a_{q} $$

      <i>Statement</i>: $\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac 1 n = 0$.<br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: Let $a_k = \frac 1 k$, and let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$.  Let $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $ \frac 1 k < \varepsilon$.  Then for every natural number $n\le p$

      $$\begin{aligned}
        |a_p-0| & = \frac 1 p \\
        &\le \frac 1 n \\
        &<\varepsilon
      \end{aligned}$$

      Therefore the $n$th tail is within $\varepsilon$ of 0, which implies $(a_k)_{k=1}$ is eventually within $\varepsilon$ of 0.  <br>

      Since $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$ was arbitrary, therefore $(a_k)_{k=1}$ is eventually within $\varepsilon$ of 0, for every $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$.  <br>

      By definition, therefore 

      $$ \lim_{k\to\infty}\frac 1 k = 0 $$

      <i>Statement</i>: Suppose $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is not bounded above.  Then $\lim_{k\to\infty}a_k$ does not exist. <br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: We prove the contrapositive, so assume that $\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = L$ exists.  <br>

      Set $\varepsilon=1$ and therefore $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is eventually within 1 of $L$.  Therefore let the $p$th tail be within 1 of $L$.  <br>

      Then $L+1\in UB_{\text{Im}(a_k)_{k=p}}$.  <br>
      
      Let $\alpha=\max\{a_k: m\le k\le p\}$.  <br>

      Then $\max\{\alpha,L+1\} \in UB_{\text{Im}(a_k)_{k=m}}$ which shows that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is bounded above.  <br>

      <i>Statement</i>: Let $(a_k)_{k=m}$ be a sequence, and $m\le p$ a natural number.  Then there is a subsequence of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ which is equal to the $p$th tail.  <br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: Define $(j_k)_{k=p}$ by $j_k = k$.  Then $a_{j_k} = a_k$ on the domain $\Bbb N^{\ge p}$.  Therefore $(a_{j_k})_{k=p} = (a_k)_{k=p}$.  <br>

      If a sequence has a limit, then every subsequence has that limit.

    <details>
      <summary>Statement and proof.</summary>

      <i>Statement</i>: Suppose $\lim_{k\to\infty} a_k = L\in\Bbb R$ and let $(a_{i_k})_{k=1}$ be a subsequence.  Then 
      $$\lim_{k\to\infty} a_{i_{k}} = L$$

      <i>Proof</i>: Let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R$ and let the $p$th tail of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ be within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.  <br>

      Since $i_k$ is strictly increasing, then for each $k\in\Bbb N$ we have $k \le i_k$.  In particular, $p\le i_p$.  <br>

      Moreover, for each $p\le q$ we have $p\le i_p\le i_q$ and therefore $a_{i_q}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.  Hence the $p$th tail of $(a_{i_k})_{k=1}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.  <br>

      This shows that $(a_{i_k})_{k=1}$ is eventually within $\varepsilon$ of $L$.  <br>
      
      But since $\varepsilon$ was arbitrary, then $\displaystyle \lim_{k\to\infty}a_{i_k} = L$.  <br>

      <i>Statement</i>: Assume that $a_n\to A, b_n\to B$ and $c\in\Bbb R$.  <br><br>

      </ol>

      <i>Proof</i>: 

      <details>
        <summary>$\lim_{k\to\infty} ca_k = cA$.</summary>

        Let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$ and set $p$ such that $(a_k)_{k=p}$ is within $\varepsilon / |c|$ of $A$.  <br>

        Then for $k\ge p$,
        $$ \begin{aligned}
          |ca_k - cA| &= |c| |a_k-A| \\
          &< |c| \cdot \varepsilon / |c| \\
          &= \varepsilon

      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>$\lim_{k\to\infty}(a_k+b_k) = A+B$.</summary>

        Let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$.  Set $p$ such that $(a_k)_{k=p}$ is within $\varepsilon/2$ of $A$.  Set $q$ such that $(b_k)_{k=q}$ is within $\varepsilon/2$ of $B$.  <br>

        Now set $r = \max\{ p,q \}$, which implies that $(a_k)_{k=r}$ is within $\varepsilon/2$ of $A$, and also $(b_k)_{k=r}$ is within $\varepsilon/2$ of $B$.  <br>

        Therefore, for $k\ge r$, we have, by algebra and then the triangle inequality,
        $$\begin{aligned}
          |(a_k+b_k)- (A+B)| &= |(a_k-A)+(b_k-B)| \\
          & \le |a_k-A|+|b_k+B| \\
          & < \frac \varepsilon 2 + \frac \varepsilon 2 \\
          &= \varepsilon 
        \end{aligned} $$
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>$\lim_{k\to\infty}a_kb_k = AB$.</summary>

        Note that from an earlier theorem (ref needed), if a sequence has a limit then it is bounded.  Let $\alpha$ be a bound on $(a_k)_{k=m}$.  <br>

        Let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$.  <br>

        First assume that one of the two limits is zero.  Without loss of generality, assume $B=0$.  <br>

        Let $(b_k)_{k=q}$ be within $\varepsilon/\alpha$ of 0.  <br>

        Then for all $k\ge \max\{p,q\}$,

        $$\begin{aligned}
          |a_kb_k - AB| &= |a_kb_k| \\
          &= |a_k||b_k| \\
          &< \alpha \cdot \varepsilon/\alpha \\
          &= \varepsilon
        \end{aligned}$$

        Next we assume that $B\ne 0$.  <br>

        Set $p$ such that $(a_k)_{k=p}$ is within $\varepsilon/|B|$ of $A$.  Set $q$ such that $(b_k)_{k=q}$ is within $\varepsilon/\alpha$ of $B$.  <br>

        Set $r=\max\{p,q\}$.  Then $\forall k\ge r$,

        $$ \begin{aligned}
          |a_kb_k - AB| &= |a_kb_k - a_kB + a_kB - AB| \\
          &\le |a_k||b_k-B| + |B||a_k-A| \\
          & < \alpha\varepsilon/\alpha + |B|\varepsilon/|B| \\
          &= 2\varepsilon
        \end{aligned}$$
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>If $b_n\ne 0\ne B$ then $\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{a_k}{b_k} = \frac AB$.</summary>

        This follows immediately from $\frac{a_k}{b_k} = a_k\cdot\frac{1}{b_k}$ and the previous result, once we have shown $\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac 1 {b_k} = \frac 1 B$.  <br>

        To show this, let $\varepsilon\in\Bbb R^+$ and let $(b_k)_{k=p}$ be within $\frac{\varepsilon|B|^2}2$ of $B$.  <br>

        Let $(b_k)_{k=q}$ be such that $\frac{|B|}{2} < |b_k|$.  Then for $k\ge \max\{p,q\}$,

        $$
\begin{aligned}
\left| \frac{1}{b_k} - \frac{1}{B} \right| 
&= {\Huge|} \frac{B - b_k}{b_k B} {\Huge|} \\
&= \frac{ |b_k - B| }{ |b_k| \, |B| } \\
&< \frac{ \varepsilon |B|^2 / 2 }{ (|B|/2) |B| } \\
&= \varepsilon
\end{aligned}
$$
