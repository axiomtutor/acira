    <h1>Lesson 0009: Sequences</h1>

    <div class="def">
        For any $m\in\Bbb N$ we define $\Bbb N^{\ge m} = \Bbb N \cap [m,\infty)$.  <br>

        For any set $X$, a <b>sequence of $X$ starting at $m$</b> is any function $a:\Bbb N^m\to X$ for any $m\in\Bbb N$.  <br>

        The image of $k$ under $a$ is written $a(k)$, using standard function notation.  However, for sequences, we prefer to write this instead as $a_k$, and we prefer to call this the <b>$k$th term of the sequence</b>.  <br>

        Although the function is denoted by $a$, for sequences we prefer to denote it as $(a_k)_{k=m}$, where $m$ is the "starting index" of the sequence.  <br>

        If $m,p\in\Bbb N$ and if $m\le p$, then we may restrict $(a_k)_{k=m}$ to the domain $N^{\ge p}$.  We denote this restriction as $(a_k)_{k=p}$, and we call this the <b>$p$th tail of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b>.  <br>

        If $(i_k)_{k=p} : \Bbb N^{\ge p} \to \Bbb N^{\ge m}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of $\Bbb N^{\ge m}$, then the composition $(a_k)_{k=m} \circ (i_k)_{k=p}$ is also a sequence of $X$.  In this case, we write this sequence as $(a_{i_k})_{k=p}$ and call this a <b>subsequence of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b>.  <br>

        If $a,b$ are elements in an ordered field, we define the <b>absolute value of $a$</b> by 

        $$ |a| = \begin{cases}
            a & \text{ if } 0\preceq a \\
            -a & \text{ if } a\prec 0
        \end{cases}$$

        We define <b>the distance between $a$ and $b$</b> by $|a-b|$.  <br>

        For a given $\varepsilon\in F^{\ge 0}$, we say that $a$ is <b>within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if $|a-b|\prec \varepsilon$.  <br>

        For a given sequence of $F$, say $(a_k)_{k=m}$, we say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is <b>within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if every term of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  <br>

        We say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is <b>eventually within $\varepsilon$ of $b$</b> if some tail of $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  <br>

        We say that $(a_k)_{k=m}$ <b>converges to $b$</b> if for every $\varepsilon\in F^+$, eventually $(a_k)_{k=m}$ is within $\varepsilon$ of $b$.  In this case we say that $b$ is the <b>limit of $(a_k)_{k=m}$</b> and we write 
        
        $$ \lim_{k\to\infty}a_k = b $$
    </div>

    Throughout this section, assume that $m,p,q\in\Bbb N$, and $(a_k)_{k=m}, (b_k)_{k=m}, (c_k)_{k=m}$ are sequences of $\Bbb R$.  Also assume that $(i_k)_{k=p}:\Bbb N^{\ge p}\to \Bbb N^{\ge m}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of $\Bbb N^{\ge m}$.

      <summary>Statement and proof.</summary>

      <i>Statement</i>: Let $x\in\Bbb R^+$ and $y\in\Bbb R$.  Then there is an $n\in\Bbb N$ such that $y < nx$.<br><br>

      <i>Proof</i>: Define $S = \{n\in\Bbb N: nx < y \}$.  If $S = \emptyset$ then $y < 1x$ and the theorem holds, so assume for the rest of the proof that $S\ne \emptyset$.  <br>

      $S$ is then bounded above by $y/x$.  Since $S$ is a nonempty set of integers, bounded above, then $\max(S)=\sup(S)$ exists.  <br>

      Therefore $\max(S)+1\notin S$ and therefore $y < (\max(S)+1)x$ by definition of $S$.  <br>

      Therefore the $n$ required by the theorem is $\max(S)+1$.  <br>
