        ## Solution 1

        1. The function $\times:(\Bbb Q\smallsetminus \{0\})\times(\Bbb Q\smallsetminus \{0\}) \to \Bbb Q\smallsetminus \{0\}$ is an *operation*, since the product of two nonzero rationals is a nonzero rational.

        Multiplication of rational numbers is *associative*.

        There is a multiplicative *identity*, which is 1.  That is because for any $x\in \Bbb Q\smallsetminus\{0\}$ we have 

        $$ 1\times x = x\times 1 = x $$

        And finally, each nonzero rational has a multiplicative *inverse*.  In particular, if $x\in\Bbb Q$ is a rational number, then it is $x=\frac p q$ for both integers, $p\ne 0 \ne q$.  Therefore its inverse is $\frac q p$, which is a rational because $p,q$ are integers and $p\ne 0$.  This is because 

        $$ \frac p q\cdot \frac q p = \frac{pq}{pq} = 1 $$
