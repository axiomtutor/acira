# A Course in Real Analysis

This is a course in real analysis, presented in a Marimo notebook!

The prerequisites are calculus and discrete math.

It covers the axioms of the real numbers, properties and topology, sequences and series of real numbers, sequences and series of real functions, limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
